# unofficial documentation fork of g.raphael #

I started this fork while learning about g.raphael and decided to record down what I know from my noobish studying of the source code. This is *NOT* an official documentation, you should keep a lookout on the [official gRaphael website](http://example.net/) for the real deal.

In the meantime, I hope this continue to serve as a easy to understand resource.

## docs folder ##

contains the various breakdown of the different g.raphael charts written in markdown.

## examples folder ##

contains examples. Often I get emails or Twitter messages asking me how to do X in gRaphael and I prefer to just make an example and post it here for other people to reference. 

## I could be wrong ##

If you spot any mistake or wish to expound on the current stuff here, please let me know.
